# Household Chore Manager

## Project Overview
A full-featured chore management system built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve real-world household coordination problems. This application implements a fair rotation system for 4 housemates with visual tracking, points system, and calendar integration.

## Problem Statement
As a live-in landlord with 3 tenants, maintaining shared spaces became challenging due to:
- Blame shifting about cleaning responsibilities
- Lack of clear accountability
- Unfair distribution of chores
- No tracking or rotation system

## Solution Features
- **Visual Chore Board**: Clear display of all weekly chores with difficulty levels
- **Fair Rotation System**: Automated chore reassignment to prevent task fatigue
- **Points Tracking**: Gamification with points for completed chores
- **Housemate Profiles**: Individual tracking with visual avatars
- **Weekly Calendar**: Overview of daily responsibilities
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Local Storage**: Data persistence across sessions

## Technical Implementation
- **Pure Vanilla JS**: No frameworks or libraries for core functionality
- **Modern CSS**: Flexbox, Grid, CSS variables, and animations
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **ES6+ Features**: Classes, arrow functions, template literals
- **Local Data Management**: In-memory state with persistence options

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **No External Dependencies**: Demonstrates proficiency with core web technologies
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript (basic HTML structure)
3. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
4. **Performance**: Minimal bundle size, efficient DOM updates
5. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of data, rendering, and event logic

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build process or server required.
