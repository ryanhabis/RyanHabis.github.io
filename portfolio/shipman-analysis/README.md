# Forensic Temporal Analysis: Harold Shipman Case

## 📊 Project Overview
Advanced data analytics case study analyzing temporal patterns in 215 confirmed murders by Harold Shipman, the UK's most prolific serial killer. This project demonstrates how modern data analytics could have enabled detection 23 years earlier through systematic pattern recognition.

## 🎯 Key Findings
- **55.8%** of murders occurred in afternoon hours (12-6 PM)
- **Peak activity** at 4:00 PM (38 victims, 17.7% of total)
- **88.8% weekday bias** with Monday peaks (51 victims)
- **60.9%** concentration in Spring/Summer months
- **Clear temporal signature** that could have triggered modern detection systems

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis
- **Chart.js** for interactive visualizations
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for web presentation
- **Git/GitHub** for version control
